\usage{
mc_calc_gdd(data, sensor, output_prefix = "GDD", t_base = 5, localities = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{cleaned myClim object see \link{myClim-package}}

\item{sensor}{name of temperature sensor used for GDD calculation e.g. TMS_T3 see \code{names(mc_data_sensors)}}

\item{output_prefix}{name prefix of new GDD sensor (default "GDD" -> "GDD5_TMS_T3")
name of output sensor consists of output_prefix and value t_base e.g. GDD5}

\item{t_base}{base temperature for calculation of GDD (default 5Â°C)}

\item{localities}{list of locality_ids for calculation; if NULL then all (default NULL)}
}
\value{
The same myClim object as input but with added virtual GDD sensor
}
\description{
This function creates a new virtual sensor for each locality within myClim data object. The new virtual sensor
provides values of GDD (Growing Degree Days) in degees Celsius for each time step in the original timeseries.
}
\details{
Function calculates growing degree days as follows:  GDD = max(0;(T - Tbase)) . period(days)
The maximum allowed time step length for GDD calculation is one day.
Function creates a new virtual sensor with the same time step as input data.
For shorter time steps than one day, the GDD value is the contribution
of the interval to the growing degree day, assuming constant temperature over this period.
Be careful while aggregating growing degree days to longer periods, because only meaningful aggregation function here is \code{sum},
but myClim let you apply any aggregation function see \code{\link[=mc_agg]{mc_agg()}}.
